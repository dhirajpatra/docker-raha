This repository holds the source of the all-in-one raha Docker image
available at:

- https://hub.docker.com/r/dhirajpatra/raha/


## Usage

Adapt the following script to your needs:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -o errexit
set -o nounset

# Create mount points
sudo mkdir -p /srv/raha/mysql
sudo mkdir -p /srv/raha/logs
sudo mkdir -p /srv/raha/config

# Stop the running container
docker stop raha || true

# Remove existing container
docker rm raha || true

# Pull the new image
docker pull dhirajpatra/raha:latest

# Run the container
docker run --detach --init \
    --hostname raha \
    --name raha \
    --restart always \
    --publish 8080:8080 \
    --volume /srv/raha/mysql:/var/lib/mysql \
    --volume /srv/raha/logs:/var/log \
    --volume /srv/raha/config:/var/www/raha/config \
    --env MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="[YOUR_AWESOME_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD]" \
    dhirajpatra/raha:latest
```

If you need to set the container to the same time zone as your host machine you
may use the following options:

```
    --env TZ=America/New_York \
    --volume /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro \
    --volume /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
```

You may use the following website to find your time zone:

- http://timezonedb.com/

Then, open `http://localhost:8080/` (or corresponding URL) in your browser
and finish the installation using the web UI.

You can find the parameters for the "Database Setup" step in your container
logs:

```
docker logs raha
```


### Using behind a SSL terminating reverse proxy

A very common use case is to use a container behind a web server configured as
a reverse proxy and handling the HTTPS connection.

To enable raha to work behind a reverse proxy first configure the trusted
proxies. From your host (where you mounted the raha configuration files):

```
sudo nano /srv/raha/config/trustedproxy.php
```

In many cases, and depending on your setup and firewall, the following might be
sufficient:

```
/*
 * Or, to trust all proxies that connect
 * directly to your server, uncomment this:
 */
'proxies' => '*',
```

#### Apache

Use the following configuration to setup the reverse proxy in Apache for
raha:

```
# Reverse proxy
ProxyPreserveHost On
ProxyPass / http://0.0.0.0:8080/
ProxyPassReverse / http://0.0.0.0:8080/

RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Port "443"
```


#### NGINX

The following is just a guess and hasn't been tested, so if you use Nginx
please confirm if the following configuration works as expected.

```
location / {
    proxy_pass http://0.0.0.0:8080/;

    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For    $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port   443;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto  https;
}
```


### Configuring email to use GSuite - Gmail SMTP

A common setup is to use a Gmail / GSuite account to send emails. To configure
raha edit mail configuration as follows:

```
sudo nano /srv/raha/config/mail.php
```

And change keys to:

```
'driver' => 'smtp',
'host' => 'smtp.gmail.com',
'port' => 587,
'from' => [
    'address' => 'your.email@your-domain.com',
    'name' => 'Your Company Name',
],

'encryption' => 'tls',
'username' => 'your.email@your-domain.com',
'password' => 'YOUR_SMTP_PASSWORD',
```


## Development

Build me with:

```
docker build --tag dhirajpatra/raha:latest .
```

In development, run me with:

```
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=[MYSQL SECURE ROOT PASSWORD] ./run/raha-dev.sh
```
